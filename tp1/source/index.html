     <p>When we define our planet, we consider things such as gravity, the core, the atmosphere,and the <br/>
     surface that is composed of water and land masses. The planet is composed of different types <br/>
     of ecosystems which, depending on their location on our planet and their position in relationship <br/>
     to the sun, range from hot and steamy to bitterly cold and blustery. Just like there are dense populations<br/>
     of people, there are dense populations of stars, and just as our earth is composed of a myriad of materials <br/>
     that are unique to earth, each galaxy is composed of a mix of gas, dust and stars that are unique to that galaxy <br>
     and held together with gravitational forces.<br/></p>
     <p>Although there are many types of galaxies, just as there are different countries, each individual galaxy,like<br/> 
     each country, is unique. There are many galaxies that exist in our universe, each one a spectacular collection<br/>
     of star systems and gas. Earth is a planet in our solar system which is found in the Milky Way Galaxy.</br>
     Over millions of years, a galaxy forms moons, planets, comets, asteroids, stars, dust, nebulae, dark matter,<br/>
     and neutron stars. Black holes also exist in galaxies,a fascinating phenomenon that pull in anything that gets too close.<br/></p>
     <p>Space is filled with emptiness, areas where nothing at all is present and galaxies are filled with empty space along with the<br/>
     other elements found in galaxies. Galaxies are in motion, and everything that is in the galaxy revolves around its center, just <br/>
     as our planets revolve around our sun, which is only one of billions found in the universe. In our galaxy, the Milky Way, our <br/>
     solar system’s sun is found on the outer portion of the arm, about 1/4 of the way in and nearly 3/4 from the central bulge.<br/></p>
     <p>The movement of all galaxies suggests that at one point in time they were all together at the same place and that something<br/>
     occurred, say like a big bang, which caused the galaxies to move away and have continued on this path for millions of years,<br/>
     moving rapidly away from each other. After many years of studying galaxies, Hubble recognized patterns and created the <br/>
     classification scheme discussed above.</p><br/>

     <h1>Galaxy classifications</h1>
     <p>
        In 1926, Edwin Hubble created a classification scheme of the galaxies, where he found four distinct types of galaxies: <br/>
        elliptical, spiral, spiral barred and irregular. Although there are different types, each galaxy contains the same  <br/> 
        elements, but these are arranged differently for each type. Just as every human is created with the same proteins that <br/>
        are configured uniquely, so are the galaxies uniquely configured with gasses, dust, stars and other elements. <br/>
