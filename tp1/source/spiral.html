        <h1>Spiral Galaxy</h1>
           <p>Spiral galaxies are easily identified by observing three components common to all spiral galaxies. A spiral galaxy<br/>
              has a disk, a bulge, and a halo. The center of the galaxy is like a nucleus, containing a sphere shaped bulge that<br/>
              houses old stars and is devoid of dust and gas. The circular shape of the galaxy composes the disk. The arms of the <br/>
              spiral galaxy originate in the disk and are where new stars will form in a galaxy.<br/></p>
          <p> The sun in our galaxy is located in one arm and its stars are created in this portion of the galaxy, which contains the<br/>
              most gas in the galaxy. This area is rich in blue stars. The Halo is a spherical shaped collection of old stars and <br/>
              clusters known as globular clusters that is found in the outer edge of the galaxy. This stunning view of Spiral Galaxy<br/>
              Messier 74 from NASA taken with the Hubble telescope shows a bright bulge in the center with the arms spiraling outward.<br/></p>
          <p> When a spiral galaxy has no arms, S0, it is termed lenticular. These galaxies are so similar to E7 that identifying them <br/>
              can be tricky. Lenticular galaxies also occur with barred spiral and are classified as SB0. Spiral galaxies are the most<br/>
              common galaxy of the known universe, comprising about 77% of all known galaxies.<br/></p>
