            A galaxy is a massive and gravitationally bound system which is comprised of stars (like the Sun), stellar remnants<br/>
             (compact stars), an interstellar medium of gas and dust, as well as the important, but misunderstood, dark matter - <br/>
             a matter hypothesized to account for gravitational effects that appear to be the result of invisible mass.

            There are over 170 billion galaxies in the observable universe yet there is also a “future visibility limit”. Objects <br/>
            beyond this limit will never enter our observable universe at any time in the infinite future. The reason for this is <br/>
            that light emitted by objects outside that limit would never reach us.
            </li><br/>
            <li>
            Tens of thousands of galaxies have been catalogued but only a few have been given well-established name like the Andromeda<br/>
            galaxy, The Milky Way, the Magellanic clouds, the Whirlpool Galaxy and the Sombrero Galaxy.

            The word galaxy is derived from the Greek word galaxias which literally means “milky”. This is a reference to the Milky Way <br/>
            galaxy which contains our solar system.

                    Galaxies are historically categorized by their apparent shape, of which there are three:
                    <ul>
                    <li>Spiral galaxies are disk-shaped with dusty, curving arms.</li>
                    <li>Irregular galaxies have an unusual or irregular shape.</li>
                    <li>An elliptical galaxy, has an ellipse-shaped light profile.</li>
                    </ul>
            </li><br/>
            <li>
             Most galaxies are between 1,000 and 10,000 parsecs in diameter. A parsec is a astronimcal unit of length. To put the number <br/>
             into perspective, one parsec is equivalent to approximately 31 trillion kilometres or 19 trillion miles.
            </li><br/>
            <li>
                    In astronomical literature, the capitalized word “Galaxy” is used to refer to our galaxy, the Milky Way. This is to <br/>
                    differentiate it from the billions of other galaxies in the universe.
            </li><br/>
            <li>
                    Most galaxies in the universe are actually dwarf galaxies. These are relatively small when compared to other galaxies<br/>
                     – roughly one hundredth the size of the Milky Way with only a few billion stars.
            </li><br/>

                    The most distant and primordial galaxy ever discovered is the catchy z8 GND 5296, which is approximately 13.1 billion <br/>
                    light years away. It was discovered in October 2013 by a team of astronomers from the University of Texas at Austin led by Steven Finkelstein.
